    <h2>Dish description</h2>
    <p>Shkmeruli is a bountiful Georgian dish that features chicken fried and then slowly simmered in a rich garlic and milk sauce, allowing it to absorb all the exquisite flavors. This dish stands out for its delicate tenderness and hearty satisfaction. It's also remarkably easy to prepare, making it an ideal recipe for those with limited cooking experience. Shkmeruli is a one-pot meal that requires just a few basic ingredients, which you likely already have in your kitchen. While you can make this dish without any special additions, incorporating a small pinch of the Georgian spice blend Khmeli Suneli will lend your Shkmeruli an unmistakable Georgian flavor, enhancing the overall taste to reflect its traditional roots perfectly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds chicken (skin-on breast, legs, and thighs)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rice flour (can be substituted with all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>5 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Khmeli Suneli spice blend (optional)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by patting the chicken pieces dry and seasoning them generously with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a medium-large heavy-bottomed pan, such as a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, until shimmering.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, mix together the rice flour and all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour mixture and then fry in the hot skillet until both sides are golden brown and crispy, approximately 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken as it finishes and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once all the chicken has been fried and removed, wipe the pan clean to remove any excess oil and flour. Melt the remaining tablespoon of clarified butter in the same pan.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and stir for about 20 seconds until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in the whole milk and bring it to a simmer, stirring in the Khmeli Suneli spice blend if using.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the chicken to the pan, and let it simmer gently for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and thoroughly cooked.</li>
            <li>Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the Shkmeruli hot, ensuring each piece of chicken is well-coated with the creamy garlic sauce for maximum flavor.</li>
        </ol>
