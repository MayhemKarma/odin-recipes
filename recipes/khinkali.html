    <h2>Dish</h2>
    <p>Khinkali are Georgian dumplings that are a favorite at dinner parties or supras. The most common version of them is meat-filled, like in this recipe. In addition to the meat, the dumplings have a brothy filling due to the juices that the raw ground meat produces when cooked.</p>
    <p>Khinkali are also similar to Manti which is a Turkish dumpling. Manti are also meat-filled but are cooked in broth and served with a yogurt sauce.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Make the dough</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour and salt in a bowl with a whisk. Add the water and beaten egg and form the dough into a ball.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth.</li>
                <li>Oil the same bowl and plop the ball of dough in. Cover and set aside for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Make the filling</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all filling ingredients except the broth in a bowl. Add broth to the mixture a little at a time and mix with a fork to help it absorb.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Make the khinkali</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut your Cut your dough ball into 3 smaller balls. Keep 2 covered in the oiled bowl as you work.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured surface until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Using a round cutter or a drinking glass and a knife, cut the dough into 6 2-1/2 inch circles. You can reroll the scraps if you need to (we do).</li>
                <li>Roll each disc out into a larger circle, approximately 4 inches in diameter. Roll the edges of the dough to be a bit thinner than the center. Lightly dust the surface and/or rolling pin with flour as needed through this process.</li>    
                <li>Place a tablespoon of filling into the center of each piece of circle. Crimp or pleat the dough's edge and twist to create a stem to form a dumpling.</li>
                <li>Put each dumpling on a floured sheet pan and cover with a towel until ready to cook. Make sure the dumplings don't touch each other.</li>                    
                <li>When you're about to start your last batch, start boiling a large pot of water with the bay leaves.</li>
                <li>When the water is boiling and your dumplings are ready to go into the pot, salt the water generously. Gently lift each khinkali by their bottoms and put them in the boiling water.</li>
                <li>Cook your khinkali in batches of 6 or 9, depending on how large your pot is.</li>
                <li>After adding the dumplings to the boiling water, gently use a wooden spoon to ensure they're not sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Cook each batch for 8 minutes. Adjust the heat if necessary to ensure a rolling, but not violent boil (you don't want the dumplings to break open while cooking).</li>
                <li>Remove the dumplings with a spider and set on a plate.</li>
                <li>Serve with freshly cracked black pepper. If you want a little more heat, you can also serve with crushed red pepper flake. If you want even more deliciousness, serve with crème fraîche or sour cream.</li>
            </ol>
